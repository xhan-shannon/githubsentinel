# Github Sentinel v0.0.1 Release Notes

## Introduction
We are excited to introduce the initial release of the 'Github Sentinel' project, an open-source tool designed to help developers and project managers stay on top of their GitHub repositories.

## Key Features
- **Scrubbed Repository Management**: Automatically detect and keep track of your organization's private GitHub repositories.
- **Update Collection**: Continuously monitor the repositories and collect the latest updates, commits, and changes.
- **Notification System**: Receive timely email notifications about the latest updates to your repositories.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on the changes and activities in your repositories.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverage the power of AI to provide intelligent insights and recommendations based on the collected data.

## Known Issues
- The email notification system currently only supports Gmail accounts. Support for other email providers will be added in future releases.
- The report generation feature does not include any visualizations or charts. This functionality will be added in the next release.

## Future Plans
- Expand the notification system to support additional communication channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
- Implement advanced analytical features using machine learning and natural language processing.
- Enhance the user interface and provide a web-based dashboard for better visualization and management.
